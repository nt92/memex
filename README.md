# Nikhil's Memex

So basically, we all have a BOATLOAD of data strewn across different apps. This is my attempt to unify my data into a common warehouse and do cool stuff with it. 'Nuff said, if you want to hear me wax poetic about this or see my progress and attempt to "build in public" you can check out my newsletter on the topic [here](https://thot.substack.com/s/building-a-memex).

## Components

This project is broken up into a bunch of sub-components (not quite microservices) that handle different parts of the memex, ranging from the data collection to the visualization to the API endpoints, etc. Each one has its own `README.md` with information to help you understand how it works.
